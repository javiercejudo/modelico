## Types

Here is a list of the built-in immutable types:

- `Enum`: simple enumerated values with optional associated data.
- `Map`: ordered map with arbitrary keys and values.
- `EnumMap`: ordered map with enum keys and arbitrary values.
- `StringMap`: ordered map with string keys and arbitrary values.
- `List`: ordered indexed collection, implemented with plain arrays, but immutable.
- `Set`: ordered collection with no repeated values.
- `Date`: much like a JavaScript date, but immutable.
- `Number`: a number wrapper to support serialisation of `-0` and Â±`Infinity` (rarely needed).
- `Maybe`: it helps with optional/nullable fields.
